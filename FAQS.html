        <p>The lawsuit claims that Kroger violated federal and California law by marketing and labeling Kroger
        Bread Crumbs as containing “0g Trans Fat” when they unlawfully contained trans fat.
        Kroger denies any wrongdoing and asserts that the formulation and labeling of Kroger Bread Crumbs
        did not violate any law. The Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the
        Southern District of California, and the case is known as Hawkins v. The Kroger Company,
        Case No. 3:15-cv02320-JM-AHG. The Court has not yet decided whether Plaintiff or Defendant is correct.

        <p>In a class action lawsuit, one or more people, called class representatives (in this case Shavonda Hawkins)
          represent the interests of similarly situated people who have the same claims, but have not filed a lawsuit.
          Together these people are a class. The person who filed the lawsuit is called the plaintiff and class

        <p>An individual who purchased Kroger Bread Crumbs has sued Defendant to recover money for herself and other
          people who bought Kroger Bread Crumbs. On November 9, 2020, the Court allowed the case to proceed as a class
          action for buyers of Kroger Bread Crumbs in California between 2010 and 2015. All these people are a Class
          or Class Members. The Court will resolve the issues in the case for all Class Members, except for those who
          choose to exclude themselves from the Class. The Honorable Jeffrey T. Miller is the federal district court
          judge assigned to the case.</p>

          <p>Plaintiff is seeking to recover money for herself and the Class based on her claim that the
            “0g Trans Fat” claim on Kroger Bread Crumbs was false, deceptive, or unlawful, and caused
            Plaintiff to purchase a product she would not otherwise have purchased. Defendant claims that
            Plaintiff should recover no money because it has not violated the law. When the case was filed,
            the Plaintiff also wanted Kroger to stop selling Kroger Bread Crumbs made with partially hydrogenated oil.
            Plaintiff is no longer seeking this relief because Kroger no longer does this.</p>
